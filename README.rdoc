== Description

Ruby-SDL-FFI is a low-level binding to SDL [1] and related
libraries using Ruby-FFI [2] or compatible FFI APIs, such as
JRuby's. It provides very basic access to SDL from Ruby [3]
without the need for a compiled C wrapper. It aims to be
platform and Ruby implementation independent.

Ruby-SDL-FFI does not attempt to provide any high-level
functionality, only to mirror the standard SDL interface.
For higher-level functionality, you should use other
libraries (Rubygame [4], Gosu [5], etc.).

1. SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
2. Ruby-FFI: http://github.com/ffi/ffi
3. Ruby: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
4. Rubygame: http://rubygame.org/
5. Gosu: http://www.libgosu.org/


== Caveats

Ruby-SDL-FFI is still in EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGES. That means:

* It may not work correctly (or at all).
* It may not be complete.
* It may change drastically with no advanced notice.

As such, this library is currently FOR THE ADVENTUROUS ONLY.
If you are not willing to continuously update your code to
match the new API, then you should wait until Ruby-SDL-FFI is
more mature and stable (i.e. version 1.0+).


== Requirements

* SDL       >= 1.2.13
* Nice-FFI  >= 0.2.0

Optional:

* SDL_image >= 1.2.7
* SDL_gfx   >= 2.0.13
* SDL_mixer >= 1.2.8
* SDL_ttf   >= 2.0.9

Ruby-SDL-FFI may work with older versions, but hasn't been tried on them.
